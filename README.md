# Hi! I am HEISENBERG (let me cook) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm the Walter White of frontend development, with a little bit of Jesse Pinkman flair. Here’s what I cook up in the lab:

- 🌐 **HTML**: Breaking bad conventions since 2010.
- 🎨 **CSS**: Designing with more style than a Heisenberg hat.
- 🚀 **JavaScript**: Making your web apps go from 0 to 60 faster than a meth lab explosion.
- ⚛️ **React and React Native**: Cooking up UI components with precision.
- 🔄 **Redux**: Managing state like a boss, without any blue crystals.
- 🌐 **Jest/Cypress**: Testing code like it’s about to go on a heist.
- 📦 **Node.js**: Backend wizardry with fewer criminal activities.
- 🐙 **Git**: Version control as smooth as a Breaking Bad plot twist.

## What I Can Do 🛠️

- Development of user-friendly and responsive websites and web applications (cooking up the perfect UI).
- Crafting intuitive and eye-catching user interfaces (better than Walter’s best recipe).
- Implementing advanced features using React and Redux (it’s like science, but for the web).
- Building APIs with Express and Node.js (less dangerous than cooking meth, I promise).
- Project management and code versioning with Git (keeping everything neat, like a clean lab).
